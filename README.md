# SIR
Simple Incident Response

# Purpose
Simple Incident Response is to be a stand alone incident response tracking system.  With the use of Security, Orcheteration and Response (SOAR) systems, there tracking of incidents no longer should be kept in the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.
This project aims to use a correct Open RESTful API, using common tools, such as NodeJS and MongoDB. Development wil use unit testing and keep a single npm build (exception is the mongodb installation).
In the end this project will allow other to quickly integrate solutions with a low chance of dependancy and platfor specific build issues.

# Status
The project is in the early stages of development. The objetives are:
* Define the base Scheme
* Create an RESTful API to the object of that scheme (current)
* Implement basic functions
* Add proper authentication
